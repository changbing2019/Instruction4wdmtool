# Instruction4wdmtool
wdmtoolbox is a nice python module which is used for handling WDM files of HSPF models (https://github.com/timcera/wdmtoolbox).
But its installation to the Windows operation with pip install command is painful.
After searching on internet, I wrote an instruction to intall the wdmtoolbox for those having similar issues as I had.
